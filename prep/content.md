  * the first thing that immediatly jummped out at me was the reviews saying a large majority of the app is paywalled (in typical apple fashion.)
  * Just seeing that, I realized the fitness app genre is largely relying on the Smart watch market, which is not accessible to everybody.
  * 3rd : Pelaton
  * Pelaton seems to be an closed source project that encorperates home gym with acessibility.
  * Their prices can range from 1k-2k  $ so a change needs too be made.
        *I did some additional  and found this website called WHOOP.

  * IVe noticed alot of these cost upwards of 8000 dollars so this may be something i can aim to tackle in my freedom project

Organizing these notes  would be easy Through 3 sections, Accessibility , Effectivness and Price.

### Accessibility 
 the most accsesible tools listed in the notes above are by far the pelaton. BEcause its publicly available and anybody from any backround can purchase it i believe this obviously takes the number one spot, Links and info is below

The close second for this catagory was the apple fitness app but i wanted to keep the Effictivness In mind because the Apple fitness app Requires a subscription ALONG with the purchase of external equipment. The apple fitness app mostly takes insperation from meditation apps because its mostly stretches and Yoga.  The Prices range from 10$ a month or 79 a year after a free trial. Links:

*https://www.apple.com/apple-one/
### Effectivness
The most effective Things in my notes are obviously the doctors equipment and prestigious doctors offices, The way i will organize this section will be cheap and accesible , Accessible and effective, Not cheap and not accesible.
