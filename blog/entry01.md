# Entry 1: Deciding on my topic (Health and exerise)
##### 10/12/25

Choosing a topic.
CONTENT
The proccess of chosing my topic was split into 4 distinct catagories. The first catagory that i tried to fill in was something that i was activly involved in. I have always sought after good health and would love doing things of that nature to help the general public. The second catagory i had to fill out was the specific Type of project i wanted to make, Ive always dremt about a website that allows you to click on different parts of the human body and displayed clean videos of how to exersize it at home. The third catagory was checking if i really wanted to so i slept on it before i made the desicion. The final catagory that had t be filled was the experience. Seeing as though im frequently adding to my notes, branching out and going in front of the class for casual code sessions, i stand by my choice of health for my freedom project.

SOURCES

Some sources i have came across about this type of intrest were sites like https://www.muscleandstrength.com/exercises/triceps
and https://www.gymshark.com/blog/article/best-tricep-exercises?srsltid=AfmBOorwSGdvstFF2ZM-SfNizVJf7poIstupBehXMToWmV0FQuzcBIJd but these sites were both extremly inendated with advertiezments and didnt reach the simplicity i was hoping for. What my idea hopes to change is the hyper profitization of sites of this nature that compromise user experience for profit.

Skills

Some skills i have aquired from working on this blog entry is the ability to surf through websites that have alot of ads without going on any detours. The fact that this is an actual problem that people who just want to work out go through directly proves my point and the need for the website i havee thought up.


Next Steps

the next steps for this project is for me to steadily continue to study html and the things that i have access to aswell as tinkering in freecodecamp to expand my areas of expertise.
