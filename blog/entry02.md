### Content: My new findings
Since writing my first blog entry I HAve downloaded a Plethora of Workout apps trying to see which ones are the best annd why the market seems to always fail. This idea came to me after I was absent for one day of PE and got instructed to walk 2 miles using a workout app recomended by the teacher. When preparing for my trek I downloaded the app the teacher recomended and a generic pedometer app and what ive found is that These apps will often PLay ads on repeat while walking. 
### my 2nd experiment
After Trying out the 2 mile walk and putting my findings in my notes app I wanted to further understannd why home gyms are so rare and why people flock to FOrmal gyms, paying quadruple the price overtime. The exectution of my second experiement started with using A pushup board for 2 days and going to the YMCA for 2 days and documenting my experience and while doing so I realized That Working out at home was significantly better but I Instintually Liked the YMCA more. the main reason Im hypothisizing is that people love havinng a Community of others and what gyms are able to do that home gyms arent is set a bar of "exclusivity" that leads to such high gym prices and people not even considering home gyms.

### EDP
Having my previous findings in mind, I wanted to come up with a solution. the idea that I have decided on solving the problem with is making a chatroom inside of the APp that i want to develope that allows for people to talk with others that workout at the same time but keeping ads to a minimum and being free. 

### conclusion

In short, Since my first blog entry I researched fetures that could help with my freedom project aswell as finding out why other executions of my idea dont work.
